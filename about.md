BrightSpyre is all here 
## Minimal Mistakes is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers. 
* Minimal embellishments --- content first.
* Large feature images for posts and pages.
* Author sidebar to pimp your bio, photo[^2], and social media links.
* Simple and clear permalink structure *(ie: domain.com/category/post-title)*

[^1]: Since open sourcing this theme I have released a couple other Jekyll themes. My website [Made Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com) is currently using a modified version of my [So Simple Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/).
